If the condition evaluates to TRUE, then the rest of actions are executed, if the condition evaluates to FALSE, the execution stops and an optional \"ELSE\" custom event can be triggered.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you require more branching logic than what this action provides we suggest you look at the \"FOS - Trigger Event(s)\" action which has a similar but more extended behaviour than this plug-in.\u003C\/p\u003E"
